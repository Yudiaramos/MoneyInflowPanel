# MoneyInflowPanel

## What is the Money Inflow Panel
It's an app for small companies to keep track of spendings and costs to maintain itself. In this app you'll be able to add and remove paychecks that might be overdue for clients or employees and also view the inflow of savings, availability and to use the money.

##  Available Features at the moment 
Since this app is still in the coding phase there might be various bugs, but the features are the possibility of build two excel sheets, one for financial management and one for employees management (payments, benefits, etc)
In these sheets you are able to add new lines of information, such as employees, new clients, benefits, payments, type of construction, value left to pay, etc. These features are here to make an easier way to build excel sheets and eventually treat the data faster.

## Future Features
The upcoming features we will be building is firstly a dashboard for a better visualization of all the financial management, being able to see all the money that was withdrawn or credited to the company.
Secondly we'd like to move from excel sheets to SQL or NoSQL (we're still avaluating the possibility of both), but the reason we decided to use excel sheets is because we're trying to facilitate for small business to take more control over the own financial situation, without the neeeding to spend more monney on professionals to build they're financial systems. But this app is obviously not an application that will replace that, more like help them save more money to evenntually make a big change like that!
